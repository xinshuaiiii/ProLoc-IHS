# ProLoc-IHS
We propose a novel IHC image protein SCL prediction model **ProLoc-IHS** that combines sequence features. First, a bimodal dataset containing IHC images and protein sequences from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and UniProt is compiled. Then, ProLoc-IHS extracts embeddings from IHC images and protein sequences using the visual language model Vision Transformer (ViT) and the protein language model ProtT5, respectively. These embeddings are fused using a cross-attention module, and the fused features are input into the feature learning module of ProLoc-IHS, which contains a multi-head attention mechanism, a feedforward neural network, and a residual connection.

Finally, the binary cross entropy (BCE) and the Focal loss function are introduced into the feature learning module to solve the multi-label classification task. Experimental results show that ProLoc-IHS outperforms other prediction models.

# How to use
## Creating a Virtual Environment
To run the code, we need to create a virtual environment using Anaconda, and install the required dependencies.The command is as follows：
```
conda create -n ProLoc-IHS pyhton=3.7.13
conda activate ProLoc-IHS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

In the `dataset/` folder, there are four CSV files:

- **`train.csv`** and **`test.csv`**: Contain labels, sequences, and metadata for training and testing.
- **`train_img_URL.csv`** and **`test_img_URL.csv`**: Contain image URLs used to download IHC images.

To download images, run:
```bash
python download.py
```

## Train and test
We provide both training and testing scripts. If you’d like to train the model from scratch, simply run:
```
python train.py
```
If you prefer to use the pretrained features and skip training, you can directly run:
```
python test.py
```
The feature extraction process is integrated into the code—no need for additional preprocessing.
